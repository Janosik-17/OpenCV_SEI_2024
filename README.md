An project using OpenCV, made for SEI.
## Usage:
To use this program there are two major ways.
### Use the facial recognition program as a standalone app.
1. Download the files and run the **main.py** sript
2. Choose the mode and let the program run.
### Use it together with the screaper script.
1. Run the **scraper.py** program first.
2. Run **main.py** \
\
**WARNING: Running main.py together with all the faces from scraper.py slows down the innitial launch a lot!**

  

## Disclaimer: 
Let me start like this, we are not resposible for the majority of this code. First of all I would like to thank ChatGPT nad Google Gemini for helping us make this possible.
