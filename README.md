# OpenCV_SEI_2024
An project using OpenCV, made for SEI.
## Disclaimer: 
This is not original work, in this stage of development we are trying to learn how to use OpenCV and other packages by using other peoples code most importantly following a youtube video by Indently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl2eEBFEHqM&t=314s. We hope to make something usefull/original, we are just not there yet.
